										<h3>Life of I.W. Bauman, 2nd part (continued)</h3>

										<p>written by Irwin W. Bauman</p>

									</header>

									<p><em>See <a href="../../bauman/autobiography/">notes from the first part</a> for background. Notes by Steve Baskauf, 3 June 2009:  "Part 3" is dated 1980 and consists primarily of comments regarding that year rather than an actual continuation of part 2.  In part 3 he comments on his loss of memory which was quite evident by that time and rendered it effectively impossible for him to finish what he had set out to write.  The writing stops at the end of what is transcribed here and the rest of the tablet is blank.  Thus it appears that nothing further was written after that.</em></p>

									<p>A ten weeks teachers' preparation course was offered annually in the spring after the seven months public school term ended and both students preparing to teach as well as teachers who tried by examinations under the County Supt. each summer tried to get a higher rating, finally reaching a permanent teachers certificate if one was able to pass the exams to that degree.  Mary (my wife) did get a permanent certificate for teaching in the grades which would be good even now in 1974.  I did not take those exams long enough to get such a certificate.  In the spring teacher training courses I often took courses meeting double time so that I finished 1st year Latin, for instance in 10 weeks as well as 1st year German.  2nd year Latin was completed similarly, and so were a number of other courses.  Since I always had to review the previous courses to continue the ones naturally following in the same field like 2nd year Latin after the previous 1st year the spring before, one became much more firmly grounded in those areas of study.</p>

									<p>Well, by the time I was eighteen years old I had enough background to pass the County Supt.'s tests for teaching and began to teach in a one room school at Gilbertsville, a village about 3 miles from home, where I taught for three years, making the trip to school from home by bicycle & walking during the early fall and boarding near the school when winter set in and the weather made travel too bad.</p>
										
									<p>Since I, as was customary at that time among Pennsylvania Germans for boys to work for their parents until 21 years of age & girls until eighteen, father helped some with my expenses at Perkiomen School from my school pay check during the three years at Gilbertsville.  By age 21 I still had a year of schooling to complete at Perkiomen to get my graduating degree and so could take college work while teaching three Saturday extension courses.</p>
									
									<p>I was asked, on the basis of my success as a teacher at Gilbertsville to become Supervising Principal of the schools in Towamencin Township about 25 miles from Philadelphia with the main schools being in Kulpsville and three one room schools in the rural areas.  I also was to start a two year high school and for two years taught all the courses from Latin, history, algebra, etc. to whatever the county required.  Mary was one of the rural teachers and it was there that we became acquainted since her home was near Saylorsburg in Monroe County.</p>
									
									<p>I decided to go to college after two years in Kulpsville and was persuaded by my cousin, Irwin Bauer, to come to Bluffton where he was a student at the time.</p>
									
									<p>I came to Bluffton for the summer terms in 1921 and after a trip back to Penna. to see Mary, came back to Bluffton for the 1921-22 term.  In the spring after this term Mary and I decided to go to Penn State College for the summer term and became engaged there.  She then came out to Bluffton where she took several required high school (academy) courses to make up some deficiencies and at the same time added some college courses which the administration allowed her to take.</p>
									
									<p>I'll deviate here to say that the above plans as we carried them out might have never occurred had the armistice of the 1st World War not been signed at the moment on the 11th of Nov. as it was.  I had been drafted to go to the army and as a conscientious objector was assigned to the Medical Corp.  Mennonites at that time were not generally very much inclined towards Pacifism.  Many of the Mennonite boys went into the army as ordinary soldiers, others to jail, like Prof. Lantz did, and others like myself chose the Medicorps as their way of meeting the situation.  I was to go to the army in the spring or early summer but then the great world wide flu epidemic killed so many soldiers in the camps that caskets could not be provided fast enough for their burial.  One Mennonite who was in the Medicorps told me that he helped stack up bodies of soldiers in training in cold storage like cordwood until the necessary caskets, etc. could be provided.</p>
									
									<p>I received another notice from the army to appear at the recruiting center in Allentown, Penna. in late summer or early fall after the epidemic had passed.  (I had the flu myself and was quite sick earlier).  I was to appear on Friday the 13th of Nov.  The Armistice went into effect on Wednesday the 11th and on Thursday morning on the 12th I received notice from the army not to report in Allentown and that turn of events I am sure changed the whole course of my life.  What it would have been otherwise I shall never know because those who were actually inducted into the army were sent to Germany as occupation troops and most stayed there two years or longer.  Many thoughts naturally come to one's mind if, as I believe, God had not intervened in my behalf, though I must confess I also feel now that I failed to do much for which He gave me opportunities in my future activities as teacher, etc.</p>
									
									<p>Now to come back to my life as a college student, and other types of work and activities in later life:  Mary and I were in Bluffton College as students.  I finished my work for a degree and received the A.B. degree in 1923.  Mary continued her studies there until 1926 and also received her A.B. degree.</p>
									
									<p>In 23 I spent the summer after graduation on a Chautauqua circuit in Illinois & Wisconsin as a so-called superintendent whose duties included going ahead of the program crew and getting the tent set up, the musical setting (piano, etc.) provided for, and acting as announcer of the various numbers on the program and introducing the program participants.  I had a high school boy as a helper in the physical work around the setting.  Another and a much harder job duty was to get a contract signed for the next year's appearance of a program troop in the same town we were in.  This was often very difficult because of the rather large money involvement - some $500.00 or more, which for that period of time was a considerable sum to raise among the inhabitants of the village or town where we were at the time.  Bankers, preachers, priests, prominent citizens, etc. had to be contacted and their signatures obtained.  I returned to Bluffton and saw Mary for a short time or it may be she had gone to Penna. where I met her but the former seems to me to have been the case.  I left for Hartford Theological Seminary where I stayed for three years, seeing Mary only for a very short time during each of those three years; once I remember in Philadelphia while she was on a girls Glee Club trip in that area.</p>
									
									<p>While at Hartford I carried on my studies, was out preaching during summer vacations, served as superintendent of the Village Street Congregatorial Mission, supervising the work where a janitor, a Boys' worker, a Social worker, and preaching every Sunday, plus pastoral visitation were involved in addition to my regular seminary work were concerned.</p>
									
									<p>I spent several summers at a New Hampshire church where one Sunday we met in an old beautiful New England Architecture church in the country and the next Sunday in the church located in the village.</p>
									
									<p>After Mary graduated in 1926 we were married - I at almost thirty years of age and she at nearly 29.  We spent our honeymoon on the job as preacher, but the people were very nice and the scenery most beautiful right on the Connecticut Rivers about ¼ mile from its Eastern bank.</p>
									
									<p>In the fall we both went to Germany on a scholarship I won at Hartford and money Mary had saved by teaching a term in the Lima Public School and stayed two years, 1 ½ yrs at Univ. of Giessen and ½ year the university of Berlin.  I wrote my thesis for the Ph.D. in German on the subject on the opposition which the University of Giessen to Count Zinzendorf's religious and missionary activities.</p>

									<p><strong>Life of Irwin W. Bauman 1980 cont. Part 3</strong></p>

									<p>Because of ill health, both physical in general and loss of memory retention which has become worse as time goes on and is rather serious by now; my wife has been and is especially now the one who makes sure that I do not miss any of my doctors' prescribed medicines but since she is often too busy in the kitchen because she has practically no help there, she expects me to help her remember the times when I should take medicines; together we don't seem to miss very many.</p>

									<p>Since a number of hospital tools and medicines, usually available in a modern hospital, are available to out patients for home use it saves one considerable money to take advantage of family doctor's services when prescriptions, etc. are needed.</p>
											
									<p><strong>Bluffton, Ohio Dec. 16, 1980.</strong></p>
										
									<p>Mary and I are still doing about the same as we have been doing.  This morning we were still getting things done that should be done while one can do them in the warm house.  I cracked some black walnuts, but the shell pieces are liable to fly all over the kitchen or where-ever one tries to get the kernels out.  I don't like to eat the kernels and Mary has still a lot on hand from previous crackings, so there is no great hurry to crack more.</p>
										
									<p>The weather is too cold for us to do anything outside, and we are getting to the end of the things we need to do now, we try to do the less necessary or desirable things inside the house.</p>
										
									<p>We hear so much over the radio about the many hostages among which are so many Americans that one wonders when this hostage situation will ease up.  For it to end suddenly is too much to expect.</p>
