										<h3>Life of I.W. Bauman, 2nd part</h3>

										<p>written by Irwin W. Bauman</p>

									</header>

									<p><em>Notes by Steve Baskauf, 3 June 2009:  This transcript is from a manuscript written by hand in an "E-Jay" brand Pencil Tablet (purchased for $0.25 from Millager's in Bluffton).  It is not dated, but from the text "Part 2" appears to have been written in 1974.  It is not known what has become of the first part or what it contained.  Some pages were torn out of the tablet and might have been that part.</em></p>

									<p>Although I did not get either financial support nor encouragement from home to go to college and get an advanced education, my parents were eager for us children to get what the public school (grades in one room school) had to offer.  The school term was seven months long and often the term was extended by what was termed "summer school".  Whenever this was offered for which additional pay was given the teacher and personally paid by the parents whose children were given the advantage of attending, my father sent us to that extended school term.</p>

									<p>I took the county examinations offered by the county Superintendent of Schools to the 8th grade pupils in the spring in each township of the county and if one passed that examination one was allowed to enter high school at no extra tax expense if one was available or if transportation to such a school was available.  The nearest high school was in Boyertown - 5 miles from home.  Not having any way to get there, none of our family among the earlier children attended, but each went to work after grade school at home or away from home if work was available.  Only my youngest brother, Stanley, got to go to that school and graduated with high honors, making it possible to go to college.</p>
										
									<p>I took the township examination in the spring after completing the 8th grade and passed as second in the class.</p>
										
									<p>From then on I worked for father during the year at the sawmill and whatever other work was to be done.  There was always a lot of cleaning up the shop where the cooking of the apple butter was done as well as the cider making equipment and the room in which the press was located.  The boiler and steam engine (before an electric motor was introduced to run the press) had to be cleaned inside and out.  I often entered the "man hole" in the boiler as a boy to clean it out thoroughly.  Flues in the boiler had to be fixed if necessary or replaced and wooden frames to place between the filled cloths as a pile of ground apples was built up to push into the press.  It was in the period between 14 yrs. and 18 yrs. of age that I wasted much time in idleness and delayed my education of the future.  Since spring was a time when not so much work was available at home, I went to Perkiomen School paying tuition with money received under conditions now abhorrent to me and working at the School as much as time allowed and work was available.  I cleaned rooms of teachers and students as well as worked during the summer for a couple of weeks cleaning the school building for the fall term to begin.</p>
