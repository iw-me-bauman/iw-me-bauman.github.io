										<h3>Sassamansville</h3>

										<p>written by John H. Bauman</p>

									</header>

									<p>John W. Bauman, my grandfather, was clearly an entrepreneur -- an impoverished entrepreneur.  He dreamt of riches and spent considerable time prospecting for precious metals.  He had a back yard forge from which I recall him withdrawing a crucible with a molten glob of metal at the bottom.  He panned enough gold to make my Uncle Stanley's wedding ring.  He found a site which contained uneconomical amounts of platinum.</p>

									<p>His mother tongue was Pennsylvania Dutch, similar to a German dialect, Platt Deutsch.  He spoke very little English, so my conversations with him were limited.</p>
									
									<p>I don't want to neglect Grandma Bauman, but I don't remember much detail.  She was a very short woman, under 5 feet, (Dad, at 5 ft. 5 1/2 inches was the tallest in his family!) and an excellent cook.</p>
									
									<p>Grandpa Bauman invented and patented a new way to cook apple butter.  Traditionally apple butter was produced by cooking apple cider in big pots heated from the bottom.  This required constant stirring to prevent scorching.  The Bauman method cooked the cider in wooden barrels with the heat provided by a steam-heated copper coil placed in the middle of the barrel.  No stirring and no burning!  Bauman's apple butter is still produced this way, but the "barrels" are now stainless steel.</p>
									
									<p>Bauman's apple butter is thicker and more purple than any other apple butter I've ever seen.  A truly unique product.</p>
									
									<p>To produce the cider for the apple butter there had to be a cider press.This press was also used for custom rendering of cider for locals from the apples they provided.  I remember the great taste of fresh cider from the outlet hose.</p>
									
									<p>I don't know the order in which these processes were incorporated, but the boiler that provided the steam to cook the apple butter and to power the cider press was fired with the bark and sawdust produced at the Bauman sawmill.  (An early example of sustainability?)  This sawmill provided custom sawing of tree trunks brought in by local residents.  The saw and the log transport were also powered by the steam.  All power was transmitted through pulleys and flat leather belts.  There must have been a steam engine, but I don't recall seeing that.  There was no electricity in Sassamansville then.</p>
									
									<p>Also on the property and also powered with steam power was the wrench factory.  Dad and Grandpa came up with the BAUMO pipe wrench which they patented,  I think it would be correct to say that the typical pipe wrench uses a rack and pinion mechanism to adjust the jaw separation.  This requires turning a screw to change the distance between jaws.  It takes a lot of turning to go from close together to wide apart.  The BAUMO has a lever which, when pressed, disengages the movable jaw so that it can be opened/closed to the proper position.  When released, the jaw is fixed in the new position.  I guess this is the meshing of two rack gears, but I'm not a mechanical engineer.</p>
									
									<p>The BAUMO was  never a commercial success, (One can, however, find them for sale on eBay, even now.)  Dad said the reason it was unsuccessful was that they never had the capital to produce a range of sizes.  In my own experience with it, I found another problem -- the jaws were not sufficiently hardened.  I don't know whether competing wrenches of that era had tougher jaws or not.</p>
									
									<p>Needless to say, the "Bauman factory complex" was a fascinating place to the young JHB.</p>
									
									<p>Something else that I'll never forget were the breakfasts in Grandpa's home.  The Pennsylvania Dutch went to work early and, after several hours of work, came in for breakfast -- a huge meal similar to any dinner with exceptional desserts.  Needless to say, the rest of the meals were also excellent.  Nobody produced shoefly pie like Grandma.  I'm sure Mother got her excellent recipe from Grandma.</p>
									
									<p>One last unforgettable site at the Bauman homestead was the out house.  For good reason, it was quite a distance from the main house.  I'd probably have even more indelible memories of it if our visits had been in the dead of winter!</p>
