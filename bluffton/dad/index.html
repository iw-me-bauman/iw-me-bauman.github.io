										<h3>I remember dad</h3>

									<p>I REMEMBER DAD</p>
									
									<p>As a very generous man. He grew up in a home where there was always a shortage of funds. Until late in his career, he worked at a job which paid very low wages. Yet he faithfully tithed -- in fact, usually went well beyond the traditional tithe. He trusted that God would take care of him -- and God did!</p>
									
									<p>As a learned man. Dad didn’t learn English till he started school -- his mother tongue was Pennsylvania Dutch. He wrote his doctoral thesis in German! Occasionally, for recreation, Dad would read books written in French, German, Greek, Hebrew or Latin. He, of course, knew history, but to fill out the curriculum of a small college, he also taught Anthropology, Economics, Family, Sociology, Labor Problems, and probably other fields. I once heard him say he had taught 55 different courses at Bluffton College!</p>
									
									<p>As a pessimist. Dad seldom looked at areas of politics or government with rose colored glasses. I recall him frequently bemoaning the time when the United States would run short of natural resources. He was well ahead of his time by realizing the importance of conservation long before the era of energy crises. I tried to remind him of his foresight several years ago, but by then, he could not really appreciate the significance of my comment.</p>
									
									<p>As a mechanical genius. I have no doubt that Dad would have excelled as an inventor or a mechanical engineer. In his youth, he and his father patented a pipe wrench. I still admire its ease of use. He was a very innovative Mr. Fix-it. Seldom did he hire craftsmen to work on his house, car or appliances.</p>
									
									<p>As a man in a hurry. Dad was, without a doubt, a Type A personality. A day just never contained enough hours for him to accomplish all he hoped to accomplish. I’ve wondered whether God gave him his first heart attack at age 55 to encourage him to “stop and smell the roses.” If so, it worked!</p>
									
									<p>As a teacher. For years Dad taught a course required of all Bluffton College freshmen, History of Civilization. It had been discontinued by the time I was a student, so I never had the opportunity to take that course, but I recall many, many favorable comments made to Dad by returning alumni. He must have given it a “mind-stretching” perspective. I also know that students frequently used Dad as a counselor to help them with their educational, vocational and personal concerns.</p>
									
									<p>As a father. I’m sure I wanted more of his time, but my childhood memories include wrestling with him (and Mary K!) on the floor after supper, walking on the Nickel Plate rails for Sunday afternoon recreation, falling into nettles as we climbed a fence on an afternoon hike (H.W. Berky supplied the baking soda to cool our skin), and summer vacations with relatives in Eastern Pennsylvania. As I grew older, he tried hard to get to athletic events when I participated, helped me work on my own cars and maintained a keen interest in my educational and vocational accomplishments.</p>
									
									<p>As a man of faith. I cannot recall a single instance where Dad’s faith seemed to waver or where he expressed doubt about his Christian faith. His was not a faith of memorized platitudes, but a faith that combined his theological training with every-day practicality. Something he continued to do very well, as his mind and hearing deteriorated, was to pray.</p>
									
									<p>Indeed, as all sons should, I remember Dad as a very special individual. Someone, who through genetics and environment, had tremendous influence on me. Someone I was proud of. Someone who deserved more thanks than I could ever verbalize. Someone who served his family, his college and his God with tremendous loyalty.</p>
