										<h3>Memorial tribute</h3>

									<p>MEMORIAL SERVICE<br/>
									First Mennonite Church<br/>
									Bluffton, Ohio<br/>
									September 21, 1986</p>
										
									<p>Dr. Irwin W. Bauman</p>
									
									<p>It is a privilege and an honor to present a few of my thoughts and memories about my dear, dear friend and teacher, Dr. Irwin W. Bauman.</p>
									
									<p>I was a major in sociology and social sciences under Dr. Bauman. He guided me in many more ways than I ever realized.</p>
									
									<p>Dr. Bauman became a faculty member in 1929 -- just one year before I became a freshman at Bluffton College -- which was in 1930. Depression years in our economy did not deter his emphasis on strong academic motivation in learning. He also provided students in his classes with practical applications of the use of knowledge to the benefit of mankind.</p>
									
									<p>I will never forget one great field trip to Appalachian Kentucky. Our class stayed in a Presbyterian mission house way back in an isolated area. It was at the Henderson School and Settlement House. I remember that the U.S. mail was carried by a man on horseback. We had such a great time and found this to motivate us in the study of Rural-Urban Sociology. We started to return home in a very dense Kentucky fog. John Keller, Ken Newland, Homer Clemens, Winfield Fretz and others were in our group. This school and mission station was located near Corbin and Pineville, Kentucky.</p>
									
									<p>Dr. Bauman really did enjoy this trip and others like it very much. He was jovial and we felt that he was interested in us and wanted us to experience how other people lived out their lives in a totally different social environment than ours.</p>
									
									<p>He talked with all types of persons while we were at the mission station. They wanted to know why we were there and how we knew about this place if we came from “far off in Ohio”.</p>
									
									<p>This was a very different learning experience for a class in Rural-Urban Sociology. Dr. Bauman must be considered a pioneer in providing these rich out of classroom field work experiences for his students.</p>
									
									<p>It is understandable why he became a valuable member of the Mennonite Central Committee. He saw poverty areas in rural America and appreciated needs all over the world.</p>
									
									<p>William Snyder, formerly executive director of MCC, was also in Dr. Bauman’s classes when he was a student in Bluffton College.</p>
									
									<p>It was also true that Dr. Bauman did introduce one of the first courses in Ohio in the field of marriage and family. A great course. One which made me think more about the field of professional counselling. His History of Civilization course indicated his widely based training in religion, ethics, political science and culture. He accepted the needed role given to him early in his career to teach courses not directly in his field, like the above examples. He also taught courses in economics, anthropology and others.</p>
									
									<p>This diversity of material could only be successfully handled by a brilliant scholar who had the talent, wisdom and dedication to pioneer in fields where others feared to tread. I admired him for his hard work, Christian commitment and the sincere cooperation of his wife, Mary.</p>
									
									<p>Dr. Bauman also was a minister part time at a church in New Stark, Ohio near Bluffton. He always preached at least once a year from this very pulpit in Bluffton at First Mennonite.</p>
									
									<p>You may not know that Dr. Bauman liked to work on his own car. I remember this well as one would frequently see him doing this type of mechanical work. He painted his own house. He did patching of plaster holes in the walls. He probably not only did this as a hobby but as an economic necessity.</p>
									
									<p>Dr. Bauman moved toward other practice fields in his own professional development. He worked for the State Rehabilitation Services for the Blind for a short period. Earlier he worked at the Toledo State Hospital. Mrs. Bauman was also there with him as they worked together.</p>
									
									<p>There were summer experiences in other places when he worked with the Chautauqua groups.</p>
									
									<p>There were the earlier years in Hartford, Connecticut where he received his seminary training. He also preached in the east at various churches as well as working in city missions while at the seminary.</p>
									
									<p>Dr. and Mrs. Bauman lived in Hartford, Connecticut after the first summer they were married. They had no car and walked to church.</p>
									
									<p>I can honestly say that Dr. Bauman had more influence on my direction in life than any other professor. I went into social work practice right out of college in 1934. I kept in touch with him. I was close to him and I will always cherish his warm smile, helpful suggestions and his strong commitment to Christian education at Bluffton College.</p>
									
									<p>Yes, Dr. Bauman: You have grown in wisdom, stature and in favor with God and man.</p>
									
									<p>-- and may God Bless each one of your family.</p>
