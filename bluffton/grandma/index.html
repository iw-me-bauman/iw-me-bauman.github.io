										<h3>Thoughts on Mary Bauman</h3>

										<p>Memories presented at her memorial service.</p>
									</header>

									<p>October 28, 1990</p>

									<p>I would like to read a compilation of thoughts on Mary Bauman, from various members of her family.</p>
									
									<p>One thing that everyone who knew Grandma seemed to appreciate about her was her sense of humor. She loved to tell stories on herself. When a granddaughter was reluctantly dusting chair rungs, Grandma would tell how, as a child, she enjoyed dusting the bedframes upstairs because she could crawl under the bed and sneak in some book reading when no one was looking.</p>
									
									<p>Grandma retained a lively curiosity and interest in learning throughout her life. She was always reading, listening to radio programs, informing herself. After the 9th grade she passed a teacher’s exam and so taught for a few years in one room school houses. This is where she met the superintendent whom she would later marry, after their college studies. Although she had a modest opinion of her own education, those around her could see that she spent her whole life educating herself and maintaining a questioning mind. She was always concerned about peace and justice issues and, unlike many of the rest of us, always took the time to write to her representatives in congress.</p>
									
									<p>Many of the radio programs she listened to were musical. She would have enjoyed being a musician herself, but, not having had that opportunity, she deeply appreciated everyone else’s music. There was never a more pleased and appreciative member of any audience than Grandma.</p>
									
									<p>Grandma’s creativity was expressed in sewing. She could make clothes without a pattern, including her daughter’s wedding dress. She also encouraged creativity in others. Grandma was strongly supportive of all our efforts, be they musical, artistic, literary, or even just painting window frames or raking leaves off the lawn.</p>
									
									<p>Grandma was in some ways a woman ahead of her time. For example, she was a “health food” fan long before it became a fad. Grandpa might buy ice cream cones or candy for the grandchildren, but Grandma distrusted sugar and fats so SHE would stuff them full of whole wheat bread, homemade yogurt, and fresh garden vegetables. In fact, when weeding the garden she would even save the healthful weeds and add them to the meal. She was also concerned about the environment. Grandma had a love of nature: she wanted to know the names of plants she saw; she loved to watch the birds; she saw the beauty in a snowy day.</p>
									
									<p>Grandma was a spunky lady who, we are told, had to be cautioned by Grandpa against jumping fences when she was pregnant, or thought it was a great adventure in Germany to spend a night on barn straw when the hotel was full. She became even more broad-minded and flexible as she aged. None of us remember her ever saying negative things about other people. She was an optimist who seemed to have the knack of being content and cheerful wherever she was. Visitors were always made welcome and almost invariably she ended goodbyes with a heartfelt “Thank you for coming!”  We feel that this is what she would want to say to each of you today.</p>
