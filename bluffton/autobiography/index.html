										<h3>Life of Irwin W. Bauman 1980 cont. Part 3</h3>

										<p>written by Irwin W. Bauman</p>

										<p><em>Notes by Steve Baskauf, 3 June 2009:  "Part 3" is dated 1980 and consists primarily of comments regarding that year rather than an actual continuation of <a href="../../germany/autobiography/">part 2</a>.  In part 3 he comments on his loss of memory which was quite evident by that time and rendered it effectively impossible for him to finish what he had set out to write.  The writing stops at the end of what is transcribed here and the rest of the tablet is blank.  Thus it appears that nothing further was written after this.</em></p>

									<p>Because of ill health, both physical in general and loss of memory retention which has become worse as time goes on and is rather serious by now; my wife has been and is especially now the one who makes sure that I do not miss any of my doctors' prescribed medicines but since she is often too busy in the kitchen because she has practically no help there, she expects me to help her remember the times when I should take medicines; together we don't seem to miss very many.</p>

									<p>Since a number of hospital tools and medicines, usually available in a modern hospital, are available to out patients for home use it saves one considerable money to take advantage of family doctor's services when prescriptions, etc. are needed.</p>
											
									<p>Bluffton, Ohio Dec. 16, 1980.</p>
										
									<p>Mary and I are still doing about the same as we have been doing.  This morning we were still getting things done that should be done while one can do them in the warm house.  I cracked some black walnuts, but the shell pieces are liable to fly all over the kitchen or where-ever one tries to get the kernels out.  I don't like to eat the kernels and Mary has still a lot on hand from previous crackings, so there is no great hurry to crack more.</p>
										
									<p>The weather is too cold for us to do anything outside, and we are getting to the end of the things we need to do now, we try to do the less necessary or desirable things inside the house.</p>
										
									<p>We hear so much over the radio about the many hostages among which are so many Americans that one wonders when this hostage situation will ease up.  For it to end suddenly is too much to expect.</p>
